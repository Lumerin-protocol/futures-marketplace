/**
 * Viem-native re-implementation of Hardhat's `loadFixture`.
 *
 * First call:                       run the fixture fn, take `evm_snapshot`,
 *                                   cache `{ snapshotId, data }` keyed by fn.
 * Subsequent calls (same fn ref):   `evm_revert` to the cached snapshot, then
 *                                   immediately re-`evm_snapshot` (Hardhat's
 *                                   snapshots are consumed on revert, so we
 *                                   have to retake one), return cached data.
 *
 * The cache is keyed by the fixture function *reference*, so each scenario
 * gets its own snapshot. Two different fixtures that build on a shared
 * baseline don't share snapshots — they each pay the full deploy cost on
 * first invocation, then are O(1) thereafter. That's the same trade-off
 * Hardhat makes; it keeps the snapshot bookkeeping trivial.
 *
 * The fixture's return value (typically the deploy addresses + viem
 * contract handles) survives revert because EVM state including deployer
 * nonces is rolled back too — addresses are deterministic in `evm_revert`'s
 * world view, so cached contract handles keep working.
